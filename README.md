GovTrack is a web application designed to enhance transparency and accountability in governance. It allows government officials to submit weekly reports on office activities and projects, while citizens can track these reports and submit infrastructure requests. Citizens can also upvote or downvote requests, helping prioritize issues that matter most to their communities.
